# How to disable the trackball marker for specific series in SfCartesianChart?

Flutter Cartesian Chart widget provides support for customizing the trackball marker to render only for the particular series of our choice in the chart using the markerVisibility property of the TrackballMarkerSettings available in the chart.

For example, consider there are two cartesian line series in the chart, and if you need to show only the trackball marker for the first series alone in the chart when the trackball is activated on user interaction, then you can use the markerVisibility property of the TrackballMarkerSettings to modify the trackball marker’s visibility mode and the series MarkerSettings property values accordingly, in order to disable the trackball marker for the particular series in the chart.
